Ok in the media folder you will find both audio interviews and text transcripts of interviews that make up my user research. 

## Design Opportunities

**Apshana Interview**

In Apshana's interview there were some key things to take away that can help better understand how to come up with some solutions. 

* She is actively working on keeping her roots. 
  * Buying groceries at Bengali grocery stores, 
  * watching Bollywood movies, 
  * Having a relationship with her family
  * Eating Bengali food
* Did not have a clear answer on if she better identifies as Bengali or Canadian
* Most time spent on Intagram or Facebook
* Her bengali identity is separate from her muslim identity
* When asked about her faith, she went pillar by pillar of her understanding of the religion
  * It is evident she has put a lot of thought and intent into what parts of religion she wishes to practice i.e.giving to the poor.
* Ramadan seems to be the practice that sticks out the most.
* When asked about curating a platform, the demands wre precise:
  * Has to be the same generation
  * Life experiences need to be a common point even within the same generation
  * Feeling of judgement would be very present, therefore revealing identity is less pleasing


**Fahim Interview**

Although Fahim's interview might come across as less insightful in terms of direct applications, there are still important design insights.

* Media consumption in diverse:
  * Streaming platforms like Youtube or Crunchyroll
  * Social media platforms like Instagram and Tiktok
* Identifies as Bengali, but only because he assumes that that's what people are truly wanting to know. He visually looks Bengali over Canadian, he says. 
* Comments on Youtube or replies on Twitter at times, but not in active discussion with communities online.
* Tries to avoid most contact with Bengali communities.
* Values the religious events to eat with his family or pray with his dad. 
* Does not wish to meet other bengalis, content with the current limited interactions he has. 
* The fear of judgement is stated as on of the reasons for why he limits his interactions.
